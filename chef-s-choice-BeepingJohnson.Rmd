## Twitch Data Set

- **source:** [Kaggle Twitch Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/aayushmishra1512/twitchdata/version/3)

- The data set consists of the top 1000 streamers on twitch and their statistics barring actual income 

- **Question:** Does stream time (*as in time that a streamer is online streaming*) have a significant effect on the amount of watch time that a streamer gets?

## Question Methodology

- The reason this question is important is because it could show that if streamers put in the time streaming a lot and consistently then they could grow.

- If this is not the case, what other feature is effecting the growth and size of channels on the top 1000?

- Is it *pure luck* or a *meritocracy* for those on Twitch?

## Top 10 chart

```{r}
#loading in data and making the first half of the table
twitch_data = read_csv("data/twitchdata-update.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
knitr::kable(twitch_data[0:5, 0:3], caption=' Top 10 Twitch Streamers and Stream Time')
# this is for later showing the disparity in watch times and stream times
ratio<-twitch_data$`Watch time(Minutes)`[twitch_data$Channel=="xQcOW"]/twitch_data$`Watch time(Minutes)`[twitch_data$Channel=="Remx"]
ratio2<-twitch_data$`Stream time(minutes)`[twitch_data$Channel=="xQcOW"]/twitch_data$`Stream time(minutes)`[twitch_data$Channel=="Remx"]
```

## Top 10 (cont.)

```{r}
# other half of the table
knitr::kable(twitch_data[6:10, 0:3], caption=' Top 10 Twitch Streamers and Stream Time')
```
## Top 10 watch time

```{r}
# creation of a pit chart for the top ten to show how they relate to each other
x<-twitch_data$`Watch time(Minutes)`[0:10]
# in order to not crowd the pie chart with long names
y=seq(1:10)
# shows percentages
pct<-round(x/sum(x)*100)
y1<-paste(y,pct, sep="; ")
y1<-paste(y1,"%",sep="")
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
pie(x,labels=y1, main='Watch Time', col=rainbow(length(y)))
plot.new()
par(xpd=T)
legend(x="top", legend= c("1: xQcOW", "2: summit1g", "3: Gaules", "4: ESL_CSGO", 
                  "5: Tfue", "6: Asmongold", "7: NICKMERCS", 
                  "8: Fextralife", "9: loltyler1", "10: Anomaly"))
par(xpd=F)
```

## Top 10 time streamed

```{r}
x2<-twitch_data$`Stream time(minutes)`[0:10]
pct2<-round(x2/sum(x2)*100)
y2<-paste(y,pct2, sep="; ")
y2<-paste(y2,"%",sep="")
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
pie(x2,labels=y2, main='Time Streamed', col=rainbow(length(y)))
plot.new()
par(xpd=T)
legend(x="center", legend= c("1: xQcOW", "2: summit1g", "3: Gaules", "4: ESL_CSGO", 
                  "5: Tfue", "6: Asmongold", "7: NICKMERCS", 
                  "8: Fextralife", "9: loltyler1", "10: Anomaly"))
par(xpd=F)
```


## Distribution of watch time among top 1k

```{r}
# shows the distribution of watch time accross the ranked channels
distr<-twitch_data$`Watch time(Minutes)`
scaledx = (distr-min(distr))/(max(distr)-min(distr))
y3<-seq(1,1000)
plot(scaledx, y3 ,ylab='Ranked Channels',xlab='watch time(Scaled)', pch=19)
```

## Differences in the top 1k

- The previous chart showed the major differences between watch time of the top 1k channels, but to put it in to better perspective allow us to look at #1 and #1000

- xQcOW (#1) has `r round(ratio)` times the amount of watch time that Remx (#1000) has

- But, he only has `r round(ratio2)` times the stream time



## Distribution of stream time among top 1k

```{r}
# shows the distribution of stream time across ranked channels
distr2<-twitch_data$`Stream time(minutes)`
scaledx2 = (distr2-min(distr2))/(max(distr2)-min(distr2))
plot(scaledx2, y3 ,ylab='ranked Channels',xlab='stream time(Scaled)', pch=19)
```

## Differences in the top 1k (cont)

- This new chart of stream times shows that there is a *bit* of a trend towards larger streamers streaming for longer but it's not very significant and as you can see below its not a good metric for predicting success
```{r}
distr2<-twitch_data$`Stream time(minutes)`
scaledx2 = (distr2-min(distr2))/(max(distr2)-min(distr2))
plot(scaledx2, scaledx ,ylab='stream time(Scaled)',xlab='watch time(Scaled)',main="watch time vs stream time", pch=19)
```


## top 5 ratios

- In this column of watch time vs stream time its clear that the ratio varies wildly without any extra visualizations
```{r}
# just to emphasize the how success is achieved differently for each channel
twitch_data$ratio=twitch_data$`Watch time(Minutes)`/twitch_data$`Stream time(minutes)`
r_tab<-data.frame(twitch_data[c('Channel','ratio')])
knitr::kable(r_tab[0:5,0:2], caption=' Top 10 Twitch Streamers w/ ratio (watch time/stream time)')
```

## predictions

- This new chart of stream times shows that there is a *bit* of a trend towards larger streamers streaming for longer but it's not very significant and as you can see below its not a good metric for predicting success
```{r}
distr2<-twitch_data$`Stream time(minutes)`
scaledx2 = (distr2-min(distr2))/(max(distr2)-min(distr2))
plot(scaledx2, scaledx ,ylab='stream time(Scaled)',xlab='watch time(Scaled)',main="watch time vs stream time", pch=19)
```

## In conclusion

- There is no significant correlation between watch time and time streamed
- Does that mean that the success of streamers is completely up to luck?
- No, but it could. The watch time seems to be a function of avg viewers and time streamed and that combination of the two varies from channel to channel
- each channel is different some are independent streamers that may stream a little but garner a large audience others are large organizations that can afford to stream all the time
- I think that if anything a more important question to ask would be if watch time should be considered a metric of success when something like income generated could be more tangible and involves amount of ads streamers run as well the income generated from stream time and large audiences
- so, if I could get data for income next time I would have to pull add frequency as well as these watch times to see if they correlate
- The machine learning aspect also showed no results other than I either need to pull more and better data or that it really is all luck when it comes to success on Twitches platform
